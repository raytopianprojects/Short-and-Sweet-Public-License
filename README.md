# Short & Sweet Public License 

The Short & Sweet Public License is a short easy to read copyleft public license. It is based on the zlib license, AGPL 3.0 public license, and the Creative Commons Share-alike public license.  

It attempts to solve copyleft licensing problems that video games and game engines suffer from. This is important as video games and their tools are the most actively edited/modded software/creative works but despite this copyleft hasn't really impacted the industry at all. This issue arises not only from the fact that copyleft software licenses are complex but also due to the fact that they either cover software or non-software works but never both, which make it difficult to license the games. 

So how does this license solve these issues? 

  1. It's short. It's only 50 more words then the MIT License. It's also clear and understandable which is great for everyone. 
  2. It covers both software and non-software by making the distinction between works that are easily alterable and those that aren't. 
  3. It is very viral making any alterations to the work (this makes mods open source), any works that use or are combined with the work, and anything         the work outputs must also be licensed under this license. 
  4. It covers network services meaning that in the cases of multiplayer games someone can't just run altered works behind a server without sharing what they altered.
  5. It prevents the license and its terms from being changed.  
  6. Distrubutions of the work must give those that have the work a URL to not only where they can freely access and download the work and this license but also to an easily alterable version of the work if the base version of the work is not easily alterable. As is often the case in complied code. 

Overall it ensures that everyone can freely access to the work and that any changes made to the work are shared.

The license can be found under license.txt in this repo. Use it if you want a copyleft license that works for you.
